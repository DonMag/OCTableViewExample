# OCTableViewExample

Simple example of displaying a UITableView, using separate classes for the delegate and dataSource, as well as a custom Protocol Delegate to pass the didSelectRow action to another class.

Note: Everything is *very* basic just to illustrate the process, and should be viewed as a learning tool -- NOT as a "copy/paste" and you're done.
